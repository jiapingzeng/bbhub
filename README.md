# bbhub
A home control hub using BeagleBone Green wireless

Features:
- (WIP) Turn on/off all Philips Hue lights with a button
- (WIP) Adjust brightness of all Philips Hue lights with a dial
- (WIP) Check current room temperature with temperature sensor

Note: Not sure if my specific unit is faulty but it seems to crash and reboot under moderate traffic. YMMV.
